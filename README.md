## Asynchronous JSON Kata/blob/master/async-json-kata.md: Getting a little deeper with Mocha and Chai

[Link to kata](/blob/master/async-json-kata.md)

This kata is aimed at those new to test driven development in Javascript and related tooling, who wish to take a step beyond typical TDD katas, applying TDD to a simple real world web development problem and learn a little more about assertion styles in Chai, testing asynchronous code and hooks in Mocha

The kata was created for a specific front end development team using a Grunt / Karma / Mocha / Chai testing set up, but could easily be adapted to other set ups.
